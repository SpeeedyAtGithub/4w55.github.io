Hello! Welcome to my webpage.
I will post anything here I feel that is good enough to be posted.

  This post is about Mnecraft 1.18-1.19 update
  As you might know, the Minecraft 1.17 update came out on June 8th, 2021.
  Mojang added such as Axolotls, Glow Squids, Spyglasses and so much more.
  But what about part two?
  Mojang announced it the same day as part one but this came later.
  You might be asking why.
  Well the reason for this is to give the coders a break and not make them code one huge update.
  What is going to be added to the 1.18 update?
  Mojang has made a snapshot of 1.18 or 21w15a.
  If you dont have Minecraft or dont have time to get on the game and check whats new I got your back :).
  Mojang has added better world generatiion for such as caves and mountains.
  Personally I think Mojang should have not added as much for the caves.
  Mojang increased the hight limit from 256 to 320 blocks.
  For more information I would go to: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.18
  Now for 1.19.
  Mojang added so many new items and by the looks of it everyone will be happy.
  There is to many blocks to put in so I will tell you about the mobs.
  
  Allay

Voted to be in the update during Minecraft Live 2021.
Can find dropped blocks or items for a player.
Picks up dropped items in loaded chunks and can carry up to a stack at a time, and cannot duplicate items or take items out of chests. it drops collected items when in range with a note block

  Frog

omes in three variants: default, tropical, and snowy.
Variants depend on the temperature of the biome.
Likes to jump on lily pads and big dripleaves.
Each variant is planned to have a unique use for players, currently unknown.
Grows from a tadpole.

  Firefly

Glows in the dark.
Are eaten by frogs.
Are currently only two pixels big, making them the smallest mob in the game.

  Tadpole

Grow up into frogs.
Can be held in buckets.
Frog type dependent on which temperature a tadpole grows in. This mob has 3 variants, tropical, temperate, and tundra.

  Warden

Spawns in the new Deep Dark biome, including within Deep Dark Cities.
The first fully blind mob (bats, despite relying almost exclusively on echolocation, still have basic eyesight).
Has a sense of smell. It detects a player who gets too close, regardless if they made any vibrations.
Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it moves toward the source of the movement.
It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.
It does not attack other Wardens.
When attacked, it path finds toward the player.
Seems to follow the same rules as the Sculk Sensor when detecting noise.
When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the sculk sensor.
If any projectile (e.g. egg, snowball, arrow) lands near the Warden, the mob inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating movement and noise. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
Does not detect players that are sneaking.
When aggravated for long enough, the warden follows the player continuously, regardless of any other distractions.
Because of this, it can detect players that are invisible.
Burns in direct daylight. 
It is the only mob that spawns in Deep Dark.
A mob designed to be extremely difficult, intended to be avoided and fled from.
Has a way to counter the strategy of building up 3 blocks to avoid attacks.
Incredibly strong, doing 32♥ × 16 damage, bringing players wearing full netherite armor from full health to 7♥♥♥♥ health points.
Currently has 500♥ × 250 health points.
At least as fast as the player's walking speed.
Seems to have knockback resistance.
The warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
The core creates a low throbbing sound as it pulses. The sound and animation seem to speed up rapidly when the warden notices a player.
Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the iron golem and enderman in height and width (the same).
Can be summoned by Sculk Shriekers; a Warden rises out of the ground nearby if too many are activated.
